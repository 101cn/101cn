# Epicyclic gear train

This project was to model individual parts, and using standard bolts, fasteners, washers and spacers to create an epicylic gear train, with a sun gear in the center with plantery gears around it, which are held in place by the main body

The main board that coats the whole gear train (in red) is fixed in place, whilst everything else is mated in position, therefore the structure can be used for simulation purposes. The gear trains can freely spin in place, and affect the other planetary gears

Looking closer, the standard bolts and washers can be seen, to fasten each planetary gear in place. The threads are designed for easier fits, whilst retaining enough tolerance for an easy assembly <br>
Bearings are put into place to increase efficiency, via reduction of frictional force and also reducing wear and strain on each plantery gear

Anti rotation key setup shows 1 of 3 methods designed to initiate rotation from the spur gear to the shaft hub <br>
Grub screw relies on pure frictional force by driving the screw through the threads and making it contact with the shaft hub <br>
Dowel pin acts like a wedge between the shaft hub and the gear, causing the gear to sping with the shaft hub
